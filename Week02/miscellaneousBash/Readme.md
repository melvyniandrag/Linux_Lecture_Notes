# Some more bash syntax


## xargs
Needed for homework!
Accepts a pipe and performs the indicated operation on all the lines given via standard in.

E.g. 
```
$ cat FILENAME
a
b
c
$ cat FILENAME | xargs touch
$ ls
a b c
$ cat FILENAME | xargs rm
```
So, for example, if you have a list of pids...
```
$ cat pids.txt
8903
7891
$ cat pids.txt | xargs kill -SIGTERM
```
will [try to] stop them by issuing a SIGTERM to each one.
