major difference:

delete the target of a softlink makes the link useless.
delete the target of a hard link and the link is still good.

examples:
Make a hard link:
ln example hardlink

make a soft link
ln -s example softlink

after making a hard link, check the link and the target with ls -i. Both have the same inode

ater making a softlink, check the link and target with ls -i. Different inodes.
