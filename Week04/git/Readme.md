Spend an hour working on a github repo. The purpose of the class is to get familiar with the git work flow. Each student needs to complete 3 pull requests.

* make the repo
* make three sub directories
  1. language  / 10 line program in your favorite programming language
  2. distro    / my favorite linux distro and why
  3. bash      / a 10 line bash program that does anything
  
Class flow is thus:
student forks the repo. 

for subdir in [ language, distro, bash ]:
 * Commits a file subdir/myname/prog.extension to the repo
 * Makes a pull request. 
 * tell me about the pr
 * I merge the pr
When all three prs are merged, student can leave or stay and help others.
