I use tmux all the time at work, couldnt live without out. You can use an older, similar tool called `screen` to give you similar functionality. But I learned tmux first, it's never lead me astray, and so I'll show it to you in this little bonus feature.

sudo apt-get install tmux
start tmux  by typing tmux
ctrl+b %
ctrl b "
ctrl b arrows
ctrl b x
hold ctrl b and use arrows

there are other commands too. You can google them if you find you like using tmux and want to learn more. Or you can checkout screen. Or if you really like the tiled look you can use emacs, or a tiling window manager like i3 or xmonad. xmonad is a tiling window manager written in haskell that I've been meaning to experiment with for a while to learn a bit of haskell, but have been too busy.
