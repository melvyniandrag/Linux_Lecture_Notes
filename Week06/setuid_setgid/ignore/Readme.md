Ignore the stuff in there. There are good and bad examples I was considering presenting in class.
Don't use system() inside a setuid program, I was going to try and demonstrate why it might be bad 
but was having a hard time coming up with an elementary but interesting example. Gave up the attempt, these
files are just here now for my reference if I run the class again.
