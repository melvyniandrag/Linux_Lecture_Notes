# Introduction
Some extra stuff that might interest you

## vim
`dd` Delete a line 
`p` paste
`u` undo
`CTRL + R` redo
`:vsplit` split vertical
`:split` split horizontal
`CTRL+W Arrow` navigate split

And now here is the really good bit. You have registers in vim that save your last `cuts`. 
Type `:reg` to see them

To paste from a register , type the register value then p. For example, if you want to paste the stuff that was 
in register `"4` you type `"4p` and it will be pasted. Very cool stuff if you hvae to keep track of a lot of cutting and pasting. I dont think windows lets you do this.

##tmux

ctbl+b c
ctrl+b n
ctrl+b p

multiple windows open at once. Like tabs.
