# Installing software from source.

!! May need to push this back if there is no time.

## Introduction
If you want some piece of software on your computer, and you're on some relatively mainsteam distribution, you will generally use a package manager. We've already been using package managers without talking too much about what they are. We just `apt-get install` stuff. 

Sometimes you want some software that isn't provided by your package manager, however. Often times, you will find packages on the internet that have instructions on how to compile and install them on your system. While doing this expertly may require some deep knowledge of C, compilation, linking, etc., oftentimes the package can be installed easily if the documentation is good.

Since we're playing with compilers and exploring how to program on Linux, I figured you should get the experience of building some software from source.

## symlinks. hard links vs soft links

Note: Just to show, look here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html search for symlinks. You will see that there is discussion of symlinks in the os module documentation. Now you know what they're talking about.
