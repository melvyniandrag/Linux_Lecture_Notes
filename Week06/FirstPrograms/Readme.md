# Installing necessary build tools

1. Python2/Python3 are installed by default
2. gcc/g++ `sudo apt-get install gcc g++` these are popular C/C++ compilers
3. clang/clang++ `sudo apt-get install clang` these are also popular C/C++ compilers
3. javac/java `sudo apt-get install default-jdk` there are many java options. I'm just picking the default one provided with apt.
