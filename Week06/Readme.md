# Week 6

This weeks lecture is about programming in a Linux environment.
We'll look at doing some Linuxy things in C so you understand how
some of the programs we use in class - e.g. `cat`, `vim`, etc. 
are coded and why they behave the way they do under certain circumstances.
If we have time we'll look at Python too.
If we have lots of time we'll look at nodeJS
